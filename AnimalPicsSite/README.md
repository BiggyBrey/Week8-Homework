### Homework Assignment: Developing a Front-End Application with CSS Framework and Axios

#### Objective
Develop a front-end application that uses a CSS framework for styling and Axios for API integration. Demonstrate your ability to create responsive designs and handle HTTP requests effectively.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Project Conceptualization**:
   - Choose a theme or problem for your front-end application (e.g., a weather app, task manager, or news feed).
   - Sketch out the layout and identify the components needed.

2. **Setting Up the Environment**:
   - Create a new folder for your project and initialize it with the necessary files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`).
   - Choose and set up a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or something else) in your project.

3. **Styling with CSS Framework**:
   - Use the chosen CSS framework to style your components and web pages.
   - Ensure your design is responsive and visually appealing.

4. **Installing Axios**:
   - Run `npm install axios` (if using a package manager) or include Axios via CDN in your HTML file.
   - Set up Axios in your JavaScript file for making HTTP requests.

5. **Implementing API Calls**:
   - Use Axios to make GET requests to an external API and display the data on your web page.
   - Implement error handling to manage any issues with the API requests.

6. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test your application thoroughly to ensure all components are styled correctly and API calls work as expected.
   - Refine your code and design as necessary.

#### Deliverables
Submit the following:
- Your project folder containing all relevant files.
- A README file detailing your approach, the CSS framework used, and how Axios was implemented.
- Ensure your code is well-commented and adheres to best practices.
